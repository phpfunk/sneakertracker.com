You can checkout the source below are just use the site.

This is a very simple web app that uses bootstrap, jquery, jqueryUI and basic JSON files to track miles for different running shoes. This was you can easily keep track of miles per pair.

It is recommended to change your running shoes every 300 miles or so. I always had trouble remembering which run was in which shoes, so I decided to make this small local app.

To use it, simply clone the repo, make sure the db folder is writeable and go. Type a shoe and the miles and submit. When typing a shoe autocomplete will fire to easily find any matching shoes.

Like I said, small, simple app. Maybe it will be useful to someone else.

I have plans to sync with Runkeeper and maybe Twitter to read hash tags and automatically log miles, but who knows if I will get to those :).
